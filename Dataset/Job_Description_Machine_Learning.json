We\u2019re one of the most active liquidity providers on electronic exchanges globally, and have leveraged a culture of open, collaborative innovation to scale the reach of our ideas and pace of iteration, without having to scale our headcount (currently, we\u2019re around 125 people across Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam).\nIn our industry, the vast majority of ideas will fail. So, since inception, we\u2019ve focused on continuous enhancement of our automated research platform and cutting-edge technology, allowing us to fail faster than the day prior, glean insights from each idea, and leverage individual contributions to the fullest across our entire organization. \nWe\u2019re led by Ben Blander and Michael Rauchman, who played key roles in the rise of electronic trading, but both recognized a major gap in the industry \u2014 a true focus on research processes coupled with an open organizational structure that fosters collaboration. \nJob description\nAs a Quantitative Researcher, your focus is on furthering the ML developments of the firm and identifying trading opportunities, but you can add even more value with strong quantitative skills and some coding proficiency to accelerate the innovation process and help others leverage your work. \nAs you get going, you\u2019ll gain new knowledge and insight into the fundamentals of market dynamics, trading strategies, and our proprietary research platform.

Every day we\u2019re competing with some of the smartest, most driven people in the world trying to take our money -- and if we don\u2019t stay at the very top of our game in research, technology, and economics, they will.\nAnd while the highly-publicized wave of high-frequency or \u201cflash\u201d trading based on sheer speed of execution might have reached its limit, we see continued opportunities with our strategy of using statistical research to outsmart the competition.\nQualifications\nWe\u2019re looking for highly analytical people (math, physics, computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, etc.) who want to help build the research-driven trading firm of the future.

Our people have been very successful in their academic careers and are joining Radix to make even more impact.\n> Creative Problem Solving and Probabilistic Thinking - You must enjoy learning and implementing new concepts quickly, combining knowledge from different domains to create new ideas, and take a data-driven and probabilistic approach to testing and implementing new ideas.\n> Team Mindset - We want people who understand 1+1 > 2 and are as committed to making the team better through sharing ideas as they are driven to improve their individual performance.\n> Mental Flexibility & Self Awareness - You\u2019ll have to frequently adapt based on new data, results, and feedback on your trading ideas and your performance.\n> Orientation for Making Money - Although we value academic training, our work is not an academic exercise. We take a hacker\u2019s approach to testing ideas, dropping projects that consume time without high upside, and focusing our next efforts on what will create the most value for the firm.\nResearch \/ Quant trading strategy skills to have or develop\n> Strong intuition and deep thinking with data sets - experience working with large, noisy data sets\n> Familiarity with classical statistical methods and knows when and how to apply them in a rigorous fashion; Easily learns how to apply new statistical methods; will seek out and learn new methods to better solve problems\n> Constantly questions finance\/trading data and stays motivated to seek answers despite most often proving that there is no correlation or signal\n> Experience in setup of research framework and execution of projects\n> Understanding of financial products, market dynamics, and microstructure\n> Low-level computer languages like C++ or Python, Java, etc.; awareness of strength in particular language and ability to solve more complex problems due to understanding nuances of the language\n_______\n* Please submit your CV\/Resume & Transcripts (UG - unofficial copy is okay) to university@radix-trading.com to apply\n**We will eventually require 2+ academic recommendation letters, but these are not required to apply upfront.

L\u2019\u00e9lectrocardiogramme (ECG) est la technique de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour mesurer le rythme cardiaque. A Withings, nous apportons une solution plus confortable avec une mesure du rythme cardiaque au poignet sans intervention de l\u2019utilisateur sur nos montres connect\u00e9es. Parmi les diff\u00e9rentes technologies de mesures du rythme cardiaque existantes, la photopl\u00e9thysmographie (PPG) est la technologie la plus couramment utilis\u00e9e dans le domaine des appareils \u00e9lectroniques grand public. Bien que cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 soit tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pandue chez les constructeurs de montre connect\u00e9es, l\u2019int\u00e9gration d\u2019un algorithme d\u2019estimation du rythme cardiaque est un probl\u00e8me complexe tant par la nature des signaux PPG que par les contraintes hardware d\u2019un appareil embarqu\u00e9.\nLe principal enjeu consiste \u00e0 atteindre des exigences \u00e9lev\u00e9es en termes de pr\u00e9cision et de fiabilit\u00e9 de la mesure du rythme cardiaque, pour des activit\u00e9s vari\u00e9es y compris impliquant des mouvements intenses de l\u2019utilisateur. La litt\u00e9rature scientifique pr\u00e9sente diff\u00e9rentes solutions mais est limit\u00e9e par le manque de base de donn\u00e9es repr\u00e9sentatives.

La principale difficult\u00e9 dans la mesure du rythme cardiaque continu sur des signaux optiques consiste \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer la pollution du signal par le mouvement et \u00e0 isoler l\u2019information pulsative ([1], [2]). Les solutions de suivi de battement temporel dans le signal optique ne sont pas robustes au mouvement [3]. Les solutions utilisant une analyse spectrale des signaux optiques et d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration sont efficaces pour suivre le rythme cardiaque lors de mouvements sp\u00e9cifiques dont le contenu fr\u00e9quentiel est distinct de la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque [2]. Les solutions les plus r\u00e9centes utilisent souvent le deep learning, qui semble \u00eatre une m\u00e9thode prometteuse pour ce probl\u00e8me ([5], [6], [7]).\nApr\u00e8s une \u00e9tude approfondie des solutions deep learning de la litt\u00e9rature, le stagiaire devra identifier les m\u00e9thodes les plus prometteuses et les plus adapt\u00e9es au cadre d\u2019application de Withings.
