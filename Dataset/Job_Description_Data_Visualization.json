As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a \"black box\" outside of their control. ThousandEyes gives organizations visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users and customers. ThousandEyes is used by some of the world's largest and fastest growing brands, including all of the top 5 global software companies, 5 of the top 6 US banks, and 45 of the Fortune 500.\nThousandEyes' pioneered Cloud and Internet Intelligence and is widely known as the 'Google Maps of the Internet.'

This rapid increase towards as-a-service models has given rise to unknown dependencies that plague enterprise teams with blindspots that are hard to discover without a new toolset. Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP, plays a critical role in the functioning of the Internet; yet few teams have deep expertise in how it impacts user experience. \nThe mission of our BGP team is to make it easier to troubleshoot Internet reachability problems that arise from BGP based changes; and more importantly clearly tie to user experience .

There is great opportunity by all people to pursue their own sustainable development and SNV is working with different groups in pursuant of the same. SNV provides services in Agriculture, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, and Renewable Energy. The recipients of these services include governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations and private sector organizations, communities, and individual households.\nBACKGROUND \nSNV is implementing a regional (multi-country) program entitled Opportunities for Youth Employment (OYE+) in partnership with the embassy of Sweden (Sida) and Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) in Zambia and Zimbabwe. OYE aims to improve the livelihoods and increase incomes for thousands of out-of-school youths (among whom at least 50% are young women) in \"green\" jobs, agri-food systems and energy. The project aims to sustainably increase youth employment and income by skills and capacity development of youth (push factor), linking these youth to market opportunities for employment and enterprise development (match factor) in growth sectors that have the concrete potential for employment creation (pull factor). The OYE approach is a market-based method to sustainably increase youth (self) employment, income and ultimately, improve livelihoods.\nThe OYE project in Zimbabwe and Zambia, is now in its final year of implementation and has collected a large amount of data in both countries. This data is predominantly stored and or archived in the OYE online database which the project established and has been operating and regularly upgrading. The project now requires the expertise of a strong candidate to intensively analyse the collected data for sensemaking, trend analysis, assessing model effectiveness, and more importantly, flagging areas of improvements (in terms of data collection processes, in data quality, in data analysis, use of data for management decision making) and develop learning materials for sharing both internally and externally. Hence the project is seeking the services of a consultant to conduct data analysis and develop powerful visuals (in the form of infographics) which SNV can use both internally and externally for knowledge sharing and to inform management decisions. The consultant will work in accordance with the agreed terms and schedules of the contract.\nJob Description\nTECHNICAL SUPPORT AREAS\n   A.
