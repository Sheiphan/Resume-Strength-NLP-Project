For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.\n\nThe Team\nYou will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low \u2013 and clients happy \u2013 by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google\u2019s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.\nOur models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it\u2019s down to the Detection team to investigate why.\nThe Detection team is core to Ravelin\u2019s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.\n\nThe Role\nWe are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.\nEvaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You\u2019ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you\u2019re investigating the veracity of the model itself.\nWe have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.\nThe work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job \u2013 and understand why both are important.\n\nResponsibilities\nBuild out our model evaluation and training infrastructure.\nDevelop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs\nWrite new features in our production infrastructure\nResearch new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour\nInvestigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).\n\nRequirements\nExperience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn).\nStrong analytical skills.\nBeing a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering.\nBeing skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences.\nThe ability to prioritise and to manage your workload.\nBeing comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.\nNice to haves\nUnderstand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI\/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.\nTensorflow and deep learning experience\nExperience with Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure.\nExperience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.\n\nBenefits\nMental health support through Spill + quarterly wellbeing day off\n\u00a31000 learning & development budget as well as Quarterly Learning Days\nComprehensive medical cover with AXA\nPension Scheme with Aviva\n25 days holiday + bank holidays + 1 extra day off for religious holidays\nFlexible working hours & remote friendly environment\nRavelin Gives Back - monthly charitable donations and regular volunteering opportunities\nTeamBandit - Fortnightly team lunches with different people from across the company\nAccess to BorrowmyDoggy\nCycle-to-Work scheme\nWeekly board game nights & budget for regular socials that anyone can organise\nWeekly Virtual exercise classes including yoga, pilates & HIIT sessions\n\n*Job offers may be withdrawn if candidates do not meet our pre-employment checks: unspent criminal convictions, employment verification, and right to work.*","153":"Company Description\nREF15836E\nNielsenIQ is a global measurement and data analytics company providing the most complete and trusted view of consumers and markets in 90 countries covering 90% of the world\u2019s population.

Our product search engine, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We\u2019re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:\n\nCan we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as \u201cdress\u201d or \u201cespresso machine\u201d?\nCan we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML.\nCan we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences.\nCan we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog.\nWe have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort.

Calliper is a mission control centre for the whole company - making data accessible and actionable for everyone.\nAggregate fragmented sources. Remove noise.

Here\u2019s some of what you will drive:\nOwn insight models: Lead the development of human and actionable insight models. These models detect patterns, trends or correlations in our customer\u2019s data. We use these findings to point the user in the right direction and guide them at every step of their data exploration journey thereafter (much like an in-house data team would).\nBuild an anomaly detection engine: It\u2019s integral that the insights we provide customers are as accurate as possible. To achieve this, we need a way to quickly flag anomalies or discrepancies to users and to get them resolved seamlessly and accurately. These anomalies could include missing data, incorrect spelling, wrong tagging and other data quirks.\nWork side-by-side with customers. You will be on the frontline with our early users (startup leaders) to understand their businesses and how we can iterate our insight models to best serve their needs.\nPlan system expansion. Execute expansion as needed to support Calliper's growth and data science needs. Build out the roadmap on how the data stack evolves with the team.\n\nHow can you grow in this role?\nA great Founding Data Scientist will be able to step up into a Team Lead role as the company scales. This means that you will have the opportunity to:\nGet more involved in hiring and building a world-class, global Data Science team\nCoach and mentor team members from many different backgrounds to grow in both their technical and leadership skills\nEnhance our data science capabilities by utilising the latest machine learning approaches and tooling\nWork on the longer-term strategic vision of Calliper, communicating with senior leadership, product management and operations\nRequirements\nWhat are we looking for in you?\nMission-driven.

We aren\u2019t precious about titles, and whilst a traditional statistics\/data science background might be great, so will many others. The important thing is you love to ship high-quality data outputs fast and can\u2019t live without getting user feedback\u200d\nSome startup experience. You should be aware of what you\u2019re getting yourself in for with an early-stage company. Things can be intense and stressful and then thrilling and euphoric all in the same day, so you need to be ready for the emotional rollercoaster. Also, you are comfortable when faced with a lot of ambiguity, both technically and organisationally. You\u2019re happy to tackle problems without a clear definition or solution\n\nWhat makes engineering at Calliper different?\nWe\u2019re creating a Data Analytics best practice. There are 100s of metrics which you can calculate to measure a business and each company today chooses its own subset and defines them in its own way. This breeds complexity and no way to disentangle signal from noise. We want to have customers narrow down to the handful of metrics and insights that really matter. Every function has gone through its own process of defining best practice: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Software engineering, etc. so it\u2019s natural that Data Practice follows the same steps.\nExciting data and machine learning challenges. As a data company, we\u2019re always trying to push the quality bar and impact of the algorithms we develop for our customers. However, it\u2019s not just about the quality of data science, we also work really hard to package them in sleek, interactive and low latency product experiences\nProtected deep work sessions. Throughout the week we make time to shield the team from distractions and reactive work. Close Slack and turn off your notifications and ship some high-quality work\nStrong advocation for great employee experience. We like using services that take care of undifferentiated work. Obviously, there are a handful of areas of the product where we need to build something custom ourselves, but in most cases, we are happy to pay for what\u2019s already tried and tested\nNo BS. No ego. Just direct communication and an honest search for truth. We want to always be improving as a team and individuals, so we leave ego at the door and always try to be intellectually honest\nTight processes, clear goals and limited chaos. We are considerate and intentional with what we are building, so we always have a clear view of the roadmap and priorities. Startups are hard enough we don\u2019t want to do crazy pivots every month\n\nYou can learn more about the wider company culture here.\n\nWhat is the stack you will start with?\nWe have made some intentional technical choices but we're still early in our journey so there is plenty of room to contribute to our roadmap. Currently, we are working with the following technologies:\nPandas, numpy, SQL for data transformations\nPython3 with type hints\nSnowflake as a data warehouse\nFivetran for data ingestion\nPostgres as a hot data storage\nPrefect for running jobs\n\nWhat are Calliper's values?\nWe strive to be thoughtful and intentional with the culture we build at Calliper.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Take ownership, deliver work you\u2019re proud of.\nHaving high personal standards and delivering quality work is very important to us.

Personalization provides the technology to serve them what they expect to find, to help them explore and find new things to enjoy, and for us to suggest things they might not be aware of that they would like. As a result, from Blend to Discover Weekly, the Personalization team is behind some of Spotify\u2019s most-loved features. Join us and you\u2019ll keep millions of users listening by making great recommendations to each and every one of them.\nThe Speak product area within Personalization uses text-to-speech technology to generate emotional, hyper-realistic AI-powered voices. This involves working with amazing actors to record high quality speech performances, working with the latest AI methods to model this data and building tools and platforms for users within Spotify to create new speech content. At every step of this process we try to ensure quality always comes first, however such emphasis on quality can be time consuming and laborious.\nThis project will explore new ways to create models that can detect quality defects in our production pipeline. These defects can range from high level features such as poor performance of a particular style of speech, to low level features such as audio artifacts in data or synthesized speech. We believe that the flip side of speech generation is speech analysis, and that in order to produce the highest quality speech generative models we need the best speech evaluation tools. \nWhat you'll do\nExplore a new application of text-to-speech technology in narrating blogs, news articles, or other user-generated content. We expect that machine learning methods can deliver engaging narrations by interpreting text structure and formatting, and by incorporating rich descriptions of any images within the articles.\nUse Python as the main programming language for data processing, model training, and model serving.
